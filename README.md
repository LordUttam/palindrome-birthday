# Is your Birthdate palindrome?

This is an app that check if a date is palindrome or not. It was made using HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript.

## How it works?

This app checks your birthdate in 4 formats dd-mm-yy, mm-dd-yy, dd-mm-yyyy, mm-dd-yyyy, yy-mm-dd, yyyy-mm-dd.
e.g. if your birthdate is 21 May 1995, then app will check for 210595, 052195, 21051995, 05211995, 950521, 19950521. 
It will show "Yoohooo! your birthday is a palindrome :)" if one of the combinations is palindrome.
If the date is not palindrome then it will show nearest date and by how many days you missed it.

## How to use:

1. Enter your birthdate in date field and click on Check button.
2. Output will be shown below the check button
